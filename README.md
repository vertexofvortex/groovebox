# groovebox
A discord bot that grooves.

## What is that project
This is another music bot for Discord. Even considering the fact that I started this bot as an educational pet-project, apparently it can be very useful for you as a Discord user who wants a bot to listen to music with his friends, and as a developer looking for a reference projects or some open-source software to commit into.

## What it can do
Groovebox can play music, obviously. Now it can play video clips from YouTube and tracks from Yandex Music. Spotify, Soundcloud, YouTube Music support is planned and probably will be implemented in the future (in which you can help me via pull request).

## State of the project
Groovebox is under active development. Some code might look awful and even cursed, but it will be refined in the future.

## License
This project falls under GNU GPL v3 license. But personally, I don't want you to use this bot as a platform for a commercial project with paid features.
